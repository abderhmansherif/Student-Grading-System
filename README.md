# Student-Grading-System
using C# and built in delegates

This project is a Student Grading System that calculates and displays students' average grades and whether they passed or failed based on a defined threshold. It uses object-oriented programming (OOP) to structure the system with Student and GradingSystem classes. I implemented delegates like Func, Predicate, and Action to handle grade calculations, pass/fail checks, and result display. Through this project, I learned how to apply functional programming concepts, improve my understanding of OOP, and develop interactive console applications in C#.
